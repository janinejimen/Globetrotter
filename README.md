### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

    Yes, they provided insight into the different technologies. I felt slightly unprepared for the flexbox features, but other than that I felt prepared.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
    I would have added more features such as the email form, an embedded map, and create a better design.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

    The project demo went well when presenting and having a consistent design throughout my presentation. I noticed that other peers went more creative and I would like to try that next time.
